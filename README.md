# Deep-VPS
Repository for the work [Variational Deep Learning of Equilibrium Transition Path Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14857), in which we develop a novel method to infer rates, time-dependent committment probabilities and the importance of reaction descriptors from a reactive trajectory ensemble. 
The repository contains the scripts and the data used for constructing the plots, as well as a Jupyter notebook that illustrates how this method can be applied to a 2D system that was discussed in the paper.
